The fault version case scripts and gcov folder inculdes the test scripts for each fault version and the .c.gcov, .c.gcov-Branches.csv and .c.gcov-Statements.csv generated for each test case.

The coverage matrix folder includes the coverage combination of the origianl and each fault version of each subject program.

The fault detection folder includes each version result folder that the comparision outputs between origianl version and each fault version and combinefault.csv. The results in each version result folder are generated by diff.py. And the combinefault.csv is generated by combinefault.py.

The python scripts folder includes all the python file that were created for automating tasks:

	read.py---it reads each case to generate coverage information in file_out.log and .c.gcov in gcov folder.

	generatecsv.py---it used gcov-compiler to generate branch and statement matrix of each case.

	combinestatements.py---it combines all .c.gcov-Statements.csv in gcov_{case} folder to generate a complete matrix.

	combinebranches.py---it combines all .c.gcov-Branches.csv in gcov_{case} folder to generate a complete matrix.

	diff.py---it compares the outputs of each faulty version with that of the correct version, recording the same as 1 and otherwise 0. it will generate a result.txt.

	combinefault.py---it combines all the result.txt to generate a complete matrix of fault dection.

	random_select.py---select 100 test cases randomly to produce a .sh

	scatter folder---it includes the scatter plots with soomthing spline. 

	images folder---it includes the scatter picture and fault detection trend picture of four programs

	matlab folder---it includes matlab source code that draw the branch and statement coverage of four programs.

Attention: Because the program replace is too large(gcov file:530340, size:4.56G). So, i just retain it's a version in "All data\01-fault version case scripts and gcov\replace\v1\gcov".  Gcov files of other versions will be generated automatically when we run read.py.
All gcov files generated for each case of schedule2, tcas and totinfo in their corresponding folder.
